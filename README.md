ListConceptExamples

This project introduces the List concept in C#, demonstrating how to define, add, remove, search, and sort elements in a list. Lists are dynamic collections that allow us to store elements of the same type and offer flexible methods for manipulating these elements.
Project Structure

The Program.cs file includes examples of:

    Creating and Initializing a List: Adding elements to a list both initially and dynamically.
    Removing Elements: Removing elements at specific positions.
    Searching for Elements: Checking if a specific element exists in the list.
    Sorting the List: Sorting elements in alphabetical or numerical order.
    Counting Elements: Getting the total number of elements in the list.

Code Examples

In this project, we cover:

    Defining a list and adding new elements with the Add method.
    Removing elements using the RemoveAt method.
    Searching for an element in the list using Contains.
    Sorting the list in ascending order using the Sort method.
    Displaying the total count of elements in the list with Count.

Example Output

    Initial list of names:
    Alice
    Bob
    Charlie
    David

    List after removing element at index 1:
    Alice
    Charlie
    David

    Charlie is in the list.

    Sorted list of names:
    Alice
    Charlie
    David

    Total number of names in the list: 3

How to Run

    Clone the repository.
    Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
    Run the Program.cs file and observe the results of list manipulations.

Purpose

This project is designed for beginners to understand how to work with the List collection in C#, including adding, removing, searching, sorting, and counting elements.
